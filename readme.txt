This repo is for testing various message decoders and math functions
of the botan crypto library (https://github.com/randombit/botan) using
AFL and libFuzzer.

Run setup.sh to pull botan master and setup the builds.

Input corpuses are in corpus/

fuzzers.cpp is the main show

To add a new fuzzer, add a suitable function to fuzzers.cpp with this signature:

int fuzz_the_thing(const uint8_t buf[], size_t len);

then add `the_thing` to the FUZZERS variable in the Makefile

Run with

make run_{llvm,afl}_the_thing

like in

make run_llvm_redc_p384

or

make run_afl_tls_client

You can pass args to LLVM using args=

make args=-max_len=96 run_llvm_redc_p384

The fuzzer entry point assumes no more than 4K of input.

Run

make cmin_llvm_redc_p384

to use afl-cmin to minimize and merge the LLVM and AFL outputs back to the corpus
